# Inst-RPI-in-VirtualBox-Mac
Installing Raspberry Pi Desktop in Virtual Box on Mac OS X Sierra

OK so I am trying to learn some new stuff and thought it would be a good idea to start to document it to the best of my ability.
There are two reasons for this
1)  So I have a reference for the future
2)  In the unlikely event someone else might try some of this stuff with the same limited knowledge I have.
I have found that while there is A SHIT TON of information about Raspberry PI and the RPI desktop, and Virtual Box and OpenHAB2 which are all interests of mine, they are not all clear and quite often conflict with each other.  Now recognize it has been a long time since I got into the details of stuff at this level so I'm not criticizing anyone who puts information out.  I'm jus trying to organize in a way that makes sense for me.

## Steps
1. Install Virtual Box on OSX Sierra
2. Make sure you have extensions installed
3. Download Raspberry Pi desktop from RaspberryPi.org
4. Create Virtual Box with debian raspberry pi desktop
5. Make sure you have additions installed 
6. Confirm that cut/paste and drag/drop work between Vbox and OSX
