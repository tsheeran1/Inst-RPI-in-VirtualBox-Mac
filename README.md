# Inst-RPI-in-VirtualBox-Mac
Installing Raspberry Pi Desktop in Virtual Box on Mac OS X Sierra

OK so I am trying to learn some new stuff and thought it would be a good idea to start to document it to the best of my ability.
There are two reasons for this
1)  So I have a reference for the future
2)  In the unlikely event someone else might try some of this stuff with the same limited knowledge I have.
I have found that while there is A SHIT TON of information about Raspberry PI and the RPI desktop, and Virtual Box and OpenHAB2 which are all interests of mine, they are not all clear and quite often conflict with each other.  Now recognize it has been a long time since I got into the details of stuff at this level so I'm not criticizing anyone who puts information out.  I'm just trying to organize in a way that makes sense for me.

## My Config
* iMac 27 inch, Mid 2010
* 2.93 Ghz Intel Core I7
* 16GB 1333 Mhz DDR3
* Startup disk 250 GB SSD (>100GB available -- probably can get by with less than this, I'm only setting up a 30-40GB VM storage)

## Steps

The steps are broken out in the files in this repository which are numbered in the order they should be followed.

Good luck
