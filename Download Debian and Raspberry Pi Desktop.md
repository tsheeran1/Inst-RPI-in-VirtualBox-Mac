# Download Debian and Raspberry Pi Desktop from RaspberryPi.org

Again, the assumption is that downloads go to ~/username/Downloads folder on iMac and that you have "sudo" privs

### Why do this?
  Raspbian is a variant of the Debian linux distribution built to run on the ARM processor integrated into the RPI.
  
  Raspbian won't run on the x86 processor the iMac uses.  Instead we need the plain Debian distribution with the Raspberry Pi desktop GUI to install in our Virtual Machine
  
  ### Steps
  
  Download Debian linux with Raspberry Pi desktop from here:  
  `https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/`
  
  You should get a file that looks like `2017-06-22-rpd-x86-jessie.iso` in your Downloads folder
  
  ##There.  Thats all for this step
  
  Next we will configure a Virual Machine and Install the operating system
  
  The fun has only started.
