# Download the standard Debian netinst image

Again, the assumption is that downloads go to ~/username/Downloads folder on iMac and that you have "sudo" privs

### Why do this?
  If you don't want the raspberry customizations and just want Debian this is the way to go
  
  ### Steps
  
  Download Debian linux netinst image from here:  
 ` https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/bt-cd/debian-9.3.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso.torrent`
 Note that this image include the xfce GUI. You can get the plain distribution that (I think) comes with gnome, but I like xfce and this is a quick way to get it
  
  You should get a file that looks like `debian-9.3.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso` in your Downloads folder.  Remember this file for the next steps
  
  ## There.  Thats all for this step
  
  Next we will configure a Virual Machine and Install the operating system
  
  The fun has only started.
